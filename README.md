# Keeper
A mighty squire to hold your inventory info in World of Warcraft.

## Description
Keeper tracks all of your items in inventory, bank, mail, void storage and equipped. When you hover an item the tooltip will contain information about who has, how many and where they're located. It also keeps track when you send items to your alts and will display information accordingly.

Additionally as a safety measure Keeper colors mail recipient box the class color of your characters if they are known owned characters. This way you will know if you send mail to your own character or not.

Upon login Keeper will remind you if the database is not complete. The addon requires you to open mail box, bank and void storage (if unlocked) to complete the database.

Note: this addon duplicates functionality offered by some other addons (for example bag addons like Bagnon) and you should disable them or the specific feature if you wish to use this addon instead.

## Dependencies
Keeper uses Ace3 and LibExtraTip which are included in the /libs directory.
